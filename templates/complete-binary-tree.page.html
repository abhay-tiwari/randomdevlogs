    <h2>What is Complete Binary Tree?</h2>
    <p>Complete binary trees are type of binary tree that has specific structural properties that makes them key concept in data structure and algorithms. In this blog post, we will learn about complete binary trees, their properties and characteristics.</p>
    <p>A Complete Binary Tree is a binary tree in which all levels of the tree are completely filled except for the last level which is filled from left to right. This means every level of tree except the last one contains maximum number of nodes possible.</p>

    <p>Example of complete binary tree is as follows.</p>
    <div class="tree">
     <div class="tree-level tree__level-1">
      <div class="node one">
        1
        <div class="edge-1"></div>
        <div class="edge-2"></div>
      </div>
     </div> 
     <div class="tree-level tree__level-2">
      <div class="node two">
        2

      </div>
      <div class="node three">

  <section class="complete-binary-tree__characteristics mt-5">
    <h2>Complete Binary Tree characteristics</h2>
    <p>Key Characteristics of Complete Binary Tree is as follows.</p>
    <h3>1. Balanced Tree</h3>
    <p>Complete Binary Trees ensures that the depth of the tree is minimized, especially when compared to other binary tree types like skewed or unbalanced binary trees.</p>

    <h3>2. Node Count</h3>
    <p> If a complete binary tree has 'h' levels (excluding the last partially filled level), it will have between 2^(h-1) and 2^h - 1 nodes. This characteristic helps in efficient space utilization.</p>

    <h3>3. Height </h3>

    <p>The height of a complete binary tree with 'n' nodes is approximately logâ‚‚(n), which indicates efficient access times for various operations.</p>

    <h3>4. Efficient Storage</h3>
    <p>Complete Binary Trees are ideal for implementing binary heaps, proirity queues and certain binary search trees due to their balanced structure and efficient node placement.</p>

  <section class="complete-binary-tree__applications">
    <h2>Applications of Complete Binary Tree</h2>
    <p>Applications of Complete Binary Tree is as follows.</p>

    <h3>1. Heap Data Structures</h3>
    <p>Complete binary trees are commonly used as the underlying structure for binary heaps. Binary heaps play a crucial role in priority queues and are essential in algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and heapsort.</p>

    <h3>2. File System Structures</h3>
    <p>In some file systems, complete binary trees are employed to organize and manage file structures efficiently.</p>

    <h3>3. Memory Allocation</h3>
    <p>Memory allocation algorithms, such as the buddy memory allocation technique, use complete binary trees to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory blocks.</p>

    <h3>4. Networking</h3>
    <p>In networking and routing algorithms, complete binary trees can be used to optimize routing tables and decision-making processes.</p>
